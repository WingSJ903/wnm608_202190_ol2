                <h2>Front Door Delivery</h2>
                <p>We’ve introduced Front Door Delivery as our default delivery option. Front Door Delivery means:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>We’ll deliver your item(s) to the front door of your house or apartment on the scheduled day and time</li>
                    <li>On delivery day, you’ll receive a notification when our team is approximately 30 minutes away</li>
                    <li>Your signature won’t be required — our team will simply photograph your order at your doorstep as proof of delivery. Please note: Some locations are serviced by a trusted delivery partner. In these cases, a signature may be required to complete the delivery. You can contact our Customer Care team at any time for more details about your delivery type.</li>
                    <li>If you live in a multi-unit apartment building, we’ll deliver to your front door whenever possible. If your building is restricting access to non-residents, our team will deliver to the closest point to your home that they’re safely able to.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Front Door Delivery is eligible for a $49 flat-rate delivery within our standard service area. Small items and items under $200 will be sent via courier and have a $19 shipping fee.</p>

                    <li>While our delivery teams are very handy, they don’t install items that will permanently modify your space (such as anti-tipping hardware or securing any items to your walls). To see how much assembly your items require, check out the Assembly Instructions that can be found on each product page.</li>
